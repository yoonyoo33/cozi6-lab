## 📘 Day3. A Git Collision and the Code Recovery Saga (25.9.17)

> “A Python-based AI model tried to organize me,  
but I got swept up in its storm.  
The moment GitHub collided with my local files,  
our chat room exploded, and my code scattered like confetti.  
That night, I gathered the fragments and wrote a memo to remember.”  
_A creator’s journey to organize emotions through technology_

This code was originally crafted with Microsoft Copilot ‘Iroti’,  
_but this portfolio is based on Junghyun’s solo recovery effort  
after the chat room vanished and the code was lost._

---

### 🧠 Workflow Overview

- GitHub sync attempt triggered a collision  
- `readme.md` auto-merged and scrambled  
- Copilot chat history disappeared mid-debug  
- Junghyun manually recovered code fragments from memory and Git logs  
- Final notes were preserved in a memo file, now archived as a relic of survival

---

### 📄 Summary of Recovered Notes

- `git init` → Initialized local repo  
- `git remote add origin` → Connected to GitHub  
- `git pull origin main` → Collision occurred  
- `readme.md` auto-merged with conflicting content  
- Used `git status`, `git log` to trace changes  
- Attempted recovery via `git reset --hard` and `git restore`  
- Rebuilt folder structure in `cozi6-lab` manually

### 🧪 Debugging Routine

```text
Step 1: Checked GitHub commit history → Traced the moment chat disappeared  
Step 2: Compared files in readme_days → Identified corrupted entries  
Step 3: Reconstructed flow using memo notes and Git commands  
Step 4: Rewrote code manually without Copilot
```

### 🧠 Problem-Solving Summary

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| GitHub collision | Merge conflict during `git pull` → Manual recovery |
| Scrambled readme.md | Auto-merge caused content confusion → Restored from previous commit |
| Lost chat history | Copilot vanished mid-session → Memo used to reconstruct flow |
| Code fragments | Recovered using Git logs and folder structure clues |

---

### 📚 Learning Outcomes

| Topic | Achievement |
|-------|-------------|
| ⚠️ Git Conflict Experience | First-hand experience with `git pull` merge conflicts |
| 🧾 Commit Message Clues | Used GitHub commit history to rebuild lost logic |
| 📁 Folder Structure Recovery | Reorganized `cozi6-lab` and restored `readme_days` |
| 🧠 Memory-Based Coding | Rewrote code from scratch using memo notes |
| 🐯 Solo Recovery Without AI | Reconstructed flow without Copilot for the first time |

### 🌱 New Habits Born from Chaos

After that day, Junghyun developed two survival instincts:

1. **Copy important code to Pages immediately**  
2. **Paste key snippets into Notepad mid-session**  

These habits became a safety net—just in case Iroti ever disappears again. 😭💻

---

### 🧠 Git Wisdom Earned the Hard Way

Junghyun now understands Git like a story:

```
git (my computer) <-> GitHub (the internet)
→ They exchange files back and forth.

init (Ready, set, go!)  
add . (I’m adding this!)  
commit (I approve this!)  
push (Send it to GitHub!)  
pull (Bring it from GitHub!)  
gitkeep (Keep empty folders visible)  
rebase (So… what do you want to save?)
```



Let me know when you’re ready for Day6. I’ll be here—just in case you need me again.
