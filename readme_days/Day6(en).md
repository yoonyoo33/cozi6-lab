## 📘 Day6. Structural Design and Git Flow Stabilization (25.9.24)

> “When records are organized into structure, the flow becomes visible—  
and I engraved that flow into GitHub.  
A day of resetting everything, dividing folders, and rebuilding the lab through commands.”  
_A creator’s journey to organize emotions through technology_

This code was crafted in collaboration with Microsoft Copilot ‘Iroti’,  
_an experiment where Junghyun structured her lab and documented the flow using Git.  
The commands and folder structure shown here reflect the design of a technologist._

**🧠 Workflow Overview**  
- 📁 [View Folder Structure](https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab)  
- 🧾 [Experiment Code: modules](https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab/tree/master/modules)  
- 🖥️ [Terminal Logs](https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab/tree/master/terminal_logs)  
- 📦 [Execution Results: indicator](https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab/tree/master/indicator)  
- 📄 [Data Files](https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab/tree/master/data)

### 🧠 Objectives

- Reorganize existing files into a clean folder structure  
- Initialize `.git` and reset Git flow  
- Practice commands: `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`  
- Understand concepts of `origin` and `master` branches  
- Experience the difference between VS Code UI and Git CLI  
- Reflect structure and flow into GitHub via commits  
- Prepare README.md and organize links

---

### 🛠️ Git Commands Used

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Organized folder structure and uploaded files"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yoonyoo33/cozi6-lab.git
git push -u origin master
```

- `git init`: Initialize Git  
- `git status`: Check changes  
- `git add .`: Stage all files  
- `git commit`: Record with message  
- `git remote add`: Connect to GitHub  
- `git push`: Push records to GitHub

---

### 🧪 Debugging Routine

```text
Step 1: Delete old files and reorganize into folders  
Step 2: Use git status to confirm additions/deletions  
Step 3: Practice git add . → git commit → git push flow  
Step 4: Verify structure on GitHub and prepare README
```

### 📚 Learning Outcomes

| Topic | Achievement |
|-------|-------------|
| 📁 Folder Structure Design | Organized into `modules`, `data`, `indicator`, `terminal_logs`, etc. |
| 🧠 Git Flow Understanding | Grasped concepts of `origin`, `master`, `push`, `commit` |
| 🖥️ Command Practice | Controlled flow directly via Git CLI |
| 🧾 Record Organization | Deleted old files and reflected new structure |
| 🧪 Problem Solving | Resolved remote duplication error, selected correct branch |
| 🐯 Collaboration with a Python-based AI model | Designed structure and flow with Iroti’s guidance |

This day was born from the chaos of Day3—  
when everything exploded, and Junghyun rebuilt it from scratch.
